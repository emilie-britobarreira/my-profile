			<h1>Hello, I'm Emilie :)</h1>

			<p>
				I am a French first-year student at ESSEC, and I am a member of the association Scool&CO. I was born on July 23rd, which makes me a Leo!♌🪐<br /> I love dancing, writing, traveling and driving. Indeed, at the age of 17, I got my driver's license.🚗<br />
				<br />
				Below is a link to one of my favorite website, Pinterest. I like it because you can always find some inspo for outfits, drawings or even travel bucket lists.🦋💐🌆<br />

			<h2>Scool&Co</h2>

				Scool&Co is an extra tutoring association for underprivileged children in Cergy.🧸<br /> In this association, I am part of the event department, which organizes events such as fund-raisings or outings.

			<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<p>
				I have been practising ballet for 14 years in my hometown. I love ballet because it allows me to relax after a long week at school.🩰<br />
				<br />
				I am also keen on traveling, and I have already visited several countries within Europe - UK, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Italy; and for my next trip, I would love to go to Canada or the US.🌎<br />

			<h2>My project</h2>
			<p>
				Since I am a creative person, I would love to work in the marketing or communication department, especially in the luxury industry.✨ <br />
				Indeed, I admire the works of the most talented Houses, such as Dior, Chanel, Saint Laurent or even Mugler. I love fashion and haute couture and I speak 4 languages: French, English, German and Italian; that's why I think this project fits me well!<br />
